five small programs that encrypt and decrypt information using a one-time pad-like system

Plaintext is the term for the information that you wish to encrypt and protect. It is human readable.

Ciphertext is the term for the plaintext after it has been encrypted by your programs. Ciphertext is not human-readable, and in fact cannot be cracked, if the OTP system is used correctly.

A Key is the random sequence of characters that will be used to convert Plaintext to Ciphertext, and back again. It must not be re-used, or else the encryption is in danger of being broken.
